# Expression-Tree
Expression evaluation using expression tree generated using binary tree.

An expression tree is a binary tree that models an expression.

Create an ADT ExpressionTree of operators : +, -, * and /and integer operands.
It hasfollowing functions:
1. InitTree(): This function creates a new expression tree and populates is using an infix expression read from user. It should appropriately handle errors in the input.
2. Traverse():This function performs in-order traversal of the tree.
3. Compute():This function evaluates each subtree and displays the in-order traversal of intermediate tree created in the process. It returns the final result of the evaluation of the expression.
4. Perform complexity analysis of all functionsin a separatetext file.
